# python-ooolib
OpenOffice.org Utility Library modules for creating OpenOffice.org  and Open Document Format (ODF) documents.

This is a clone of the ooolib project from sourceforge.net. The code was partialy adjusted (removed tabulators, extra brackets, etc.). It was added extra attributes for the Calc cells: border, padding, wrap and hyphenate.
